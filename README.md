This library was mainly created to share [some code on content-authorisation](https://github.com/guardian/content-authorisation/blob/afe5bd36364cde229d0bc03d6f1ca61bfc1f64c0/content-authorisation/src/main/scala/com/gu/authorisation/provider/GeneratedTokens.scala) so it can be reused elsewhere.

To build locally type publishLocal, but if you need scala 2.11 version do
```
++ 2.11.12
publishLocal
```
